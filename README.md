Andy NewFin's first attempt of The Odin Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors!

I had lots of trouble with this project. One thing I should of done first was type some "pseudocode". 
As I was working through each section of the project, I had to reread/restudy many of the articles and tutorials.

One of my first drafts contained way too many lines of code. My accounting brain wanted to type a code for every
"Rock - Paper - Scissor" outcome. I believed these lines of code caused the human player to lose every game,
even if the human player selected an item that should have beat the computer selection

Another issue I had was formatting and typos. I need to work on:
	-Making sure I do NOT capitalize syntax/strings that do NOT need it; this caused some errors 
	-Remembering where the punctuations are needed/not needed
		- I was either missing or incorrectly adding ;

My second try was better since game ran in the browser (console.log) ok, but a big issue I ran into was 
	-the player vs computer comparisons needed to display the match result
	-the loop at the end of the match
		-I tried loop provided by TOP "for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) { // code }" but could NOT
		get it to work

Since my second try was mostly ok, I decided I would seek out some help to solve my issues and finish the project
	-The mods and other students the discord here are very helpful! It is great having
	other people that are familiar with the project
